Then from your command line:

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app in development
npm run start:dev

# Build the production version
npm run build

# Build and run the production version
npm run start

# Compile the production bundle to executable binary
npm run compile
```

> **_IMPORTANT:_** When you run the executable binary, ensure you have the proper `.env` file in the same directory as the binary.
